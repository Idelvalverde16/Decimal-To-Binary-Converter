# Decimal-To-Binary-Converter
Learning recursion by building a Decimal to Binary Converter.

Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself. This can reduce a complex problem into simpler sub-problems until they become straightforward to solve.

In this project, I built a decimal-to-binary converter using JavaScript. I learned the fundamental concepts of recursion, explored the call stack, and built a visual representation of the recursion process through an animation. Practicing in https://www.freecodecamp.org.
